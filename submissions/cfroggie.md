* The divergence of a @vector is the rate at which fluid enters or leaves a small region around a point.
* The curl of a @vector is the rate at which fluid rotates around a point.
* The integral over the closed curve of a @vector dotted with the derivative of another vector is the circulation of the first vector around the curve.
* A @vector has two components in 2-D space and three components in 3-D space.
* A @vector field is made up of vectors that show what happens to the function at those points.
