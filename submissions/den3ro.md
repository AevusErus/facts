I love my hometown of @Richmond, VA, so I thought it would be interesting to give you a few fun facts about the city.

----

* @Richmond became the capital of the "Dominion of Virginia" in 1780, named after Elizabeth I (September 7, 1533 – March 24, 1603) of England.
* @Richmond is the third largest metropolitan area in Virginia, after "Northern Virginia" (bordering Washington DC) and the "Hampton Roads" area, which includes Norfolk, Hampton Roads and Virginia Beach.
* Everyone’s favorite creepy writer Edgar Allen Poe grew up in @Richmond. The Edgar Allan Poe Museum houses many of his works and some personal effects, and is considered to be the oldest building in Richmond.
* Actor, producer, screenwriter and director Warren Beatty, and his sister, Academy Award winner Shirley MacLaine were both born in @Richmond.
* The Nascar Sprint Cup is held each year at the @Richmond International Raceway. The Raceway is thought to be one of the best places to watch Nascar (though I've never been and don't plan to go).
